# About Me

<div class="description col-lg">
<p>Hi, I'm <span>Sachchit</span>, a 4th year computer science student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I found early on that I had a <span>love of learning</span> and a <span>desire to create</span>, which luckily translates well into a career in <span>software engineering</span>. My goal is to funnel that passion into designing and building software systems that can make our lives easier.</p>

<p>Over the past 4 years I've explored a variety of software engineering subdisciplines, eventually finding my niche in <span>backend engineering</span>. Outside of computer science, I also have a background in both mathematics and business.</p>
